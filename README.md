# Case Study 1


# Purpose of Projects
You can assume that your audience is the CEO and CFO of Budweiser (your client) and that they only have had one class in statistics and have indicated that you cannot take more than 7 minutes of their time. 20% of your grade will be based on the presentation. 


# Conclusion
Conclusion of this project was that there were strong evidence to predict that the United states has a clear apptitude to drink beer.  This was support by comparing 
the Amount of brewieres that were all over the country. A supprising finding was a strong evidence of a relationship between ABV and IBV. As alocholic level tends to increase the bitternes of the beer become more prevalent. The exersice was very formative about the topic, helped me learn to understand how beers bitterness tends to happen as alochol.
